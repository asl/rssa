\title{Nested Filter-adjusted O-SSA decomposition}

\description{
  Perform nested decomposition by Filter-adjusted O-SSA (FOSSA).
}

\usage{
  fossa(x, nested.groups, FILTER = diff, gamma = 1, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{SSA object holding the full one-dimensional SSA (Basic 1D-SSA, Toeplitz SSA) decomposition}
  \item{nested.groups}{vector of numbers of eigentriples from full decomposition
    for nested decomposition. The argument is coerced to a vector, if
    necessary }
  \item{FILTER}{function or numeric vector of impulse response
    coefficients for filter adjustment}
  \item{gamma}{weight of filter adjustment. See `Details' and `References'}
  \item{\dots}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link{decompose}}
    routines}
}

\value{
  Object of class `ossa'. The field `ossa.set' contains the vector of indices
  of elementary components used in Filter-adjusted O-SSA (that is, used in nested.groups).
}

\details{
  FOSSA serves for decomposition of series components that are
  mixed due to equal contributions of their elementary components, e.g. of
  sinusoids with equal amplitudes or of complex-form trend and
  periodics. FOSSA performs a new decomposition of a part of the
  ssa-object, which is given by a set of eigentriples. Note that
  eigentriples that do not belong to the chosen set are not changed.
  
  In particular, Filter-adjusted O-SSA performs a nested decomposition
  specified by a number of eigentriples via Oblique SSA with a specific
  inner product in the row space:
  \deqn{%
    \langle x, y \rangle = (x, y) + \gamma^2(\Phi(x), \Phi(y)),
  }{<x, y> = (x, y) + gamma^2(Phi(x), Phi(y))}
  where \eqn{(\cdot, \cdot)}{(., .)} denotes conventional inner product and
  `\eqn{\Phi}{Phi}' is function (supposed to be linear operator, but
  right now no additional checks are performed)
  or linear filtration which is specified by \code{FILTER} argument.

  The default value of \eqn{\Phi}{Phi} corresponds to sequential
  differences, that is, to derivation. Such version of Filter-adjusted
  O-SSA is called `DerivSSA'. See `References' for more details.
